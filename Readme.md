# DSA in Python

1. Linked list ( Arrays )
2. Hash Funtions ( Dictionary )
3. Stack ( not list but function know as dequeue)

Trees are pending to code and starting with sorting and searching

. Binary Search - Method of searching the element in sorted array
     HOW ? - Compare the search element with the middle element, if the element is smaller shift left    ( Assuming Ascending ordered array ) and Vice Versa

. Bubble Sort - Take a First element and comapre to the next element if it is bigger then swap and       repeat the process start 

. Quick Sort - Insert the first element ( Pivot Element ) in middle such that left side elements are
        smaller and right side are larger , now you get 2 arrays ( left and right ) repeat ths sane process for both arrays in recursion
